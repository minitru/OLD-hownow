									<h3>biorhythms</h3>
									<p>how:now calculates you biorhythms every day.  The idea is that when the lines are low, you're low physically, emotionally, or intellectually.  On the other hand, when the lines are high, you're in great shape.  However, the real thing to watch out for is when the lines cross the center line... those are known as 'critical days', and you need to pay attention more carefully...

									<h3>HALT</h3>
									<p>This is the HALT graph... HALT stands for Hungry-Angry-Lonely-Tired.  These states are generally transient, meaning they don't last for too long; however, it's important to keep track of them since they, probably more than any other emotions, can adversly affect our behavior and actions.</p>

									<h3>FSPD</h3>
									<p>This graph denotes other, less transient states which often affect our emotional state.  This is the FSPD graph - short for Fear, Sick, Pain, and Drunk.  Any of these elements has an obvious impact on our emotional state - so it's wise to keep track of them.
