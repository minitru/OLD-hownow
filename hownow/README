EMOTAG/HOWNOW - DATABASE STRUCTURE
==================================

PRETTY WELL FIXED NOW>

run createtables.php to rebuild the tables (almost)
- friend invite code isn't connecting friends

- twitter integration is broken (comment it out)
- graphing is broken (and should be updated anyhow)

I destroyed the database thinking I'd never need it again.  Wrong.
So let's rebuild it here.  Shouldn't take too long.

login.php is helpful
